        <br />
        The South Liberty Public Library (SLPL) was established in 1896 to serve the people of South Liberty, Iowa, USA.
The idea to establish a library, to provide a room for reading and games for the local young people, came about in 1896, when South Liberty had already existed for fifty-seven years.
